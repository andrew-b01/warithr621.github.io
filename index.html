				<h2>Who am I?</h2>

					<p>That's a really good question. As you can tell, my name is indeed Warith Rahman. I'm a rising sophomore going to Allen High School in Texas.
						I decided to create this website as a method of organizing all I have done in my life thus far, as well as including whatever happens in the near future.</p>
					<p>I've enjoyed doing math for a long part of my life, and it's always great to learn new concepts and help others expand their knowledge! I've also recently picked up
						competitive programming as an additional hobby on my day-to-day basis, and enjoy keeping up with the latest soccer news and playing video games in my free time.</p>
